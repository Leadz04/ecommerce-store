4. Generate a new app password for "Mail"
5. Copy the 16-character password

### 2. Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root with the following variables:

```env
# Database
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/ecommerce-store

JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-here

# Email Configuration (Gmail SMTP)
EMAIL_USER=testleadz04@gmail.com

# Alternative: Use APP_PASSWORD instead of EMAIL_PASS
# APP_PASSWORD=your_gmail_app_password_here

NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-nextauth-secret-here
```

### 6. Troubleshooting

If emails are not being sent:

1. Verify your Gmail app password is correct
2. Check that 2-Step Verification is enabled on your Google account
3. Ensure the environment variables are properly set
4. Check the server console for error messages
5. Verify that the Gmail account has "Less secure app access" enabled (if needed)

### 7. Production Considerations

For production deployment:
- Use environment variables provided by your hosting platform
- Consider using a dedicated email service like SendGrid or Mailgun for better deliverability
- Set up proper error logging and monitoring for email failures

## API Endpoints

- `POST /api/email/contact` - Send contact form email
- `POST /api/email/order-confirmation` - Send order confirmation email

Both endpoints return JSON responses and handle errors gracefully.
